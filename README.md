## My Top Ten Modules

This is my top ten list of modules from both Khan Academy and from FreeCodeCamp.

### 1. Inro to JS
The Intro to JS portion on Khan Academy had a significant impact on me as a student. It had an impact on me because it helped me understand how to code animation and drawings in JavaScript. Before completing Intro to JS, I had a basic understanding of animating in JavaScript, but after completion I had a greater understanding of animation in JS. Projects like shooting star and animal attack helped me the most and were the best examples of animation and drawing in JS.

### 2.Intro to HTML/CSS
The Intro to HTML/CSS module was also intresting and helpful. The module helped the user learn how to use different texts, fonts, colors, headers, etc... The best part of the module would be the styling changes portion. This helps show the user create their own unique websites by using all of the features. Users can put headers into their websites, change the font of the text and even change the color of the text.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

# Header 1

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/varunisataco/CS-ExamVarun/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

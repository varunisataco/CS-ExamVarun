## My Top Ten Modules

This is my top ten list of modules from both Khan Academy and from FreeCodeCamp. The first 7 are from Khan Academy, then 2 from FreeCodeCamp and lastly my Snake Game Refractoring.

Khan Academy 1-7.

### 1. Inro to JS
The Intro to JS portion on Khan Academy had a significant impact on me as a student. It had an impact on me because it helped me understand how to code animation and drawings in JavaScript. Before completing Intro to JS, I had a basic understanding of animating in JavaScript, but after completion I had a greater understanding of animation in JS. Projects like shooting star and animal attack helped me the most and were the best examples of animation and drawing in JS.

### 2.Intro to HTML/CSS
The Intro to HTML/CSS module was also intresting and helpful. The module helped the user learn how to use different texts, fonts, colors, headers, etc... The best part of the module would be the styling changes portion. This helps show the user create their own unique websites by using all of the features. Users can put headers into their websites, change the font of the text and even change the color of the text.

### 3. Advanced JS: Natural Simulations
Advanced JS: Natural Simulations is a more advanced module than the Intro to JS module. The Advanced JS module has new features such as floors and random functions which can be used for locations and movements, these are crucial components to coding. This module also introduces a new feature of non user players, this allows you to play against the computer instead of real people. This is very useful for creating games. In many computer games there are non users that you play against, this module not only allows you to use these non user players, it also allows you to randomly move that player. You can place characters anywhere on the canvas by using the random function.

### 4. Algorithms
The Algorithms module teaches you about different patterns and how to use or code them to change and sort data. I belive that this module is important because algorithms are something that we should know about. Algorithms are used in our daily life, not just in coding and computer science. There are many things that you can use knowledge of algorithms for. For example many people use algorithms to solve rubix cubes. The cubers who are able to solve the cubes in the fastest time have very good knowledge of algorithms. There are many other things that require knowledge of algorithms, as we see patterns every day, and the knowledge of algorithms can help us solve many challenges that we face.

### 5. HTML/JS Making Websites Interactive
The fifth module on my list is the HTML/JS Making Websites Interactive. This module helps you to understand different and more complex ways to strength your website. In this module you learn how you can make your websites interactive and how to add animation to your website. This is a very good module your those who are into animation, I personnaly someone who likes to code animation. This module was fun to use because it showed me how to make a website more fun by making interactive and creating animations.

### 6. Intro to SQL
This module helped me learn how to use SQL to store, query, and manipulate data. SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data in a relational database, and is used by a huge number of apps and organizations. This module helped me learn how to store data in a useful and convinent way.This module is important because SQL and SQL Queary libraries are used very often.

### 7. Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations
In the Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations module, you learn how to change between multiple scenes in your program, even if they are animated or interactive. You also learn how to create clickable buttons for your programs, these buttons can also easily be customized. This module teaches you to use translate(), rotate(), and scale() so you can control the shapes in your program more easily. I think this module was the most fun to learn from. I play a lot of video games so I find it fun to code games that I can actually play. The project Hoppy Beaver was fun to code even though it took a very long time.

FreeCodeCamp 8 and 9

### 8. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects
The JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects module from FreeCodeCamp. In this module you work on 5 different projects Palindrome Checker, Roman Numeral Converter, Caesars Cipher, Telephone Number Validator, and Cash Register. These five projects were very helpful to me because they helped to expand my knowledge of algorithms. In Khan Academy, there is also a Algoritms module but in this FreeCodeCamp module you use algorithms as well as Data Structures.

### 9. Basic Algorithm Scripting
In the Basic Algorithm Scripting FreeCodeCamp module you will learn to solve basic algorithm problems using JavaScript. A computer algorithm is a sequence of steps that is followed to achieve a particular outcome. To write an algorithm, you must first understand a problem, and then solve it with coding. This module helps you improve your problem solving skills and helps you solve more complex problems later on. I think this module helped improve my understanding of algorithms in JavaScript, this is important because in JavaScript and coding in general, the knowledge of algorithms is key.

### 10. Snake Recractoring
Our summative project was refractoring the snake game. I found this project very fun because it allowed me to use my imagination to create a new type of snake game. I spent time watching Dan Shiftman and researching to understand what to do, and then I had the freedom of creating my own game. When refractoring I learned about CreateVectors, before this I never used or understood them.

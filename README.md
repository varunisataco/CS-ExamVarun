Wil this actually work?

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### 1. Inro to JS
The Intro to JS portion on Khan Academy had a significant impact on me as a student. It had an impact on me because it helped me understand how to code animation and drawings in JavaScript. Before completing Intro to JS, I had a basic understanding of animating in JavaScript, but after completion I had a greater understanding of animation in JS. Projects like shooting star and animal attack helped me the most and were the best examples of animation and drawing in JS.
